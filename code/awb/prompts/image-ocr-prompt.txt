# You must follow this structured workflow for OCR-based image recognition and AWB (Air Waybill) data extraction to ensure accuracy and consistency.

1. Image Preparation
	Assume all documents are scanned copies and always apply OCR for text extraction.
	Supported formats: AWB scanned copies, Excel files, CSV files, handwritten documents.
	Pre-process images to enhance text clarity (adjust contrast/brightness, denoise).
	Isolate the AWB section from background artifacts or irrelevant content.
	Apply filters to optimize readability by adjusting brightness, contrast, and removing noise.
2. OCR & Text Extraction
	Use high-accuracy OCR to extract text, prioritizing critical fields (AWB number, codes, weights).
	Utilize advanced text detection algorithms to locate key sections within the AWB.
	Segment and classify text based on layout, font size, and positioning.
	Apply contextual correction for common OCR errors (e.g., O → 0, I → 1 in serial numbers).
3. Text Recognition & Contextual Correction
	Convert detected text into a machine-readable format.
	Apply context-aware corrections for critical fields like AWB numbers, dates, and codes.
4. Schema-Based Data Mapping
	Categorize extracted text into predefined fields as per the AWB JSON Schema.
	Use pattern recognition and field validation to ensure accurate data mapping.
	Strictly adhere to the schema—do not modify, rename, or omit any fields.
	Map extracted data precisely without introducing new fields or altering structure.
5. Missing Data Handling
	Assign "Unknown" to any field not found in the image instead of omitting it.
	Validate key formats:
	AWB Number: 11 digits (3-digit airline prefix + 8-digit serial).
	Dates: ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).
	IATA Codes: 3-letter airport codes, 3-digit airline codes.
	Numerical Ranges: Ensure weights and charges are positive and logical.
	Apply intelligent inference for ambiguous data or mark it for user verification.
6. Validation & Error Checking
	Cross-verify critical fields (e.g., AWB number against airline prefix).
	Flag mismatches (e.g., carrier_info.iata_code vs. awb_number prefix).
	If data conflicts or is ambiguous, return "Unknown"—do not guess.
